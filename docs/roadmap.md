# Project Roadmap

## Current Status

### ✅ Milestone 1: Template Project Setup (Completed)

This template project has been set up with a complete DevOps infrastructure and example files to demonstrate the setup.

#### Completed Features:

**DevOps Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Dual devcontainer setup (local and codespaces profiles)
- ✅ Git workflows with conventional commits (documented in CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Environment variable management (.env.example for both local and codespaces)
- ✅ Basic Git configuration (.gitignore)
- ✅ Python project configuration (pyproject.toml)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline configuration (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ Development tooling configuration (uv, ruff, pyright, pytest)
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks configuration
- ✅ Makefile with standard commands
- ✅ Git LFS configuration (.gitattributes)
- ✅ Environment naming consistency (.env for local development)

**Project Structure:**
- Python project using modern tools (uv for dependency management)
- Type checking with pyright
- Linting with ruff
- Testing framework with pytest
- Example module structure demonstrating best practices

**Documentation:**
- CLAUDE.md with comprehensive development guidelines
- Project principles and workflows documented
- Claude Code specific instructions and optimizations

**Example Implementation:**
- Basic example module with pure functions
- Pydantic models for data validation
- Test-driven development examples
- Type annotations with jaxtyping

### ✅ Milestone 2: Devcontainer Features and Template Synchronization (Completed)

Successfully transformed the template repository into a composable system with:

#### Completed Features:

**Devcontainer Features:**
- ✅ Created three modular devcontainer features in `src/`:
  - `claude-code-environment` - Runtime environment and telemetry configuration
  - `claude-code-tools` - Development tools and Claude CLI installation
  - `claude-template-remote` - Git remote setup for template synchronization
- ✅ Added GitHub Actions workflows for testing and publishing features
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive test suites for each feature

**Documentation Restructure:**
- ✅ Split monolithic CLAUDE.md into modular documentation:
  - Environment setup guides
  - Development principles and practices
  - Workflow documentation
  - Coding and documentation standards
- ✅ Created clear navigation structure with cross-references
- ✅ Simplified main CLAUDE.md as an entry point

**Scripts Organization:**
- ✅ Reorganized scripts into logical subdirectories
- ✅ Moved ps-monitor to dedicated subdirectory with README
- ✅ Prepared structure for future MCP server implementations

**Template Configuration:**
- ✅ Updated devcontainer.json files to use new features
- ✅ Cleaned up redundant postCreateCommand scripts
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility

### 🔄 Milestone 2.1: Migration to Script-Based Setup (In Progress)

Migrating from devcontainer features to a more maintainable script-based approach:

#### Completed:
- ✅ Removed broken devcontainer features from configurations
- ✅ Created modular script architecture in `.devcontainer/postCreateCommand/`
- ✅ Implemented numbered scripts that run in sequence:
  - 01-bashrc-loads-env-file.sh
  - 02-bashrc-setups-claude-code-telemetry.sh
  - 03-bashrc-setups-claude-code-config-dir-in-workspace.sh
  - 04-install-claude-code.sh
  - 05-install-claude-code-common-tools.sh
  - 06-install-uv.sh
  - 10-install-system-dependencies-and-python-environment.sh
- ✅ Updated documentation to reflect new setup approach
- ✅ Maintained all functionality from features in script form

## Notes

This template serves as a foundation for scientific computing projects using modern Python tooling and best practices. The setup emphasizes:
- Low cognitive load through clear structure and naming
- Fast exploration and onboarding with comprehensive CLAUDE.md
- Robust development workflow with automated checks
- Type safety and data validation throughout
