# Milestone 2: Devcontainer Features and Template Synchronization

**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS - Repository migration underway

**Last Updated**: 2024-06-18

## Executive Summary

This milestone is transforming the monolithic template-universal repository into two purpose-specific repositories:

1. **[claude-code-devcontainer-features](https://github.com/JoernStoehler/claude-code-devcontainer-features)** - ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - Reusable devcontainer features
   - Published to GitHub Container Registry
   - Used by any project needing Claude Code tools

2. **[claude-code-shared-templates](https://github.com/JoernStoehler/claude-code-shared-templates)** - üöß TODO
   - Project template with pre-configured development environment
   - Shared resources (CLAUDE.md, docs, scripts, etc.)
   - Enables bidirectional synchronization between projects

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Four Devcontainer Features

Located in `src/`, each feature provides specific functionality:

- **`claude-code`** - Core Claude Code CLI installation and configuration
- **`claude-code-telemetry`** - Optional OpenTelemetry configuration for monitoring
- **`claude-code-common-cli-tools`** - Essential development tools (ripgrep, fd, bat, etc.)
- **`claude-code-shared-templates-git-remote`** - Git remote setup for template synchronization

### 2. Restructured Documentation

Split the monolithic CLAUDE.md into modular documentation under `docs/claude/`:
- Environment setup guides
- Development principles
- Workflow documentation
- Coding standards

This makes information easier to find and maintain.

### 3. Reorganized Scripts

Moved from flat structure to organized subdirectories:
- `scripts/ps-monitor/` - Process monitoring tool
- `scripts/mcp-servers/` - Placeholder for future MCP implementations

### 4. Added CI/CD Infrastructure

- `.github/workflows/test-features.yaml` - Tests features across multiple base images
- `.github/workflows/release-features.yaml` - Publishes features to GitHub Container Registry

## Current State

### ‚úÖ What's Complete

**claude-code-devcontainer-features repository:**
- All 4 features implemented and pushed to main branch
- Test scripts included for each feature
- GitHub Actions workflows ready for testing and publishing
- Comprehensive README with usage examples
- MIT License

### üöß What's In Progress

**Migration from template-universal:**
- Features have been extracted and pushed to new repository
- Original template-universal still contains everything
- Need to create claude-code-shared-templates repository

### ‚ùå What's Not Done

**claude-code-shared-templates repository:**
- Repository exists but is empty (only auto-generated README)
- Needs all non-feature files from template-universal
- Must update references to new repository URLs

**Publishing and Testing:**
- Features not yet published to ghcr.io
- GitHub Actions workflows not yet triggered
- No testing done on the new repository structure

## Next Steps for Handoff

### Immediate Tasks

**üìã See detailed handoff document: `docs/tasks/milestone-2-repository-migration-handoff.md`**

1. **Publish Features from claude-code-devcontainer-features**
   - Go to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/JoernStoehler/claude-code-devcontainer-features/actions)
   - Run "Release Dev Container Features" workflow
   - Features will publish to `ghcr.io/joernstoehler/claude-code-devcontainer-features/`

2. **Set up claude-code-shared-templates repository**
   - Copy all non-feature files from template-universal
   - Update devcontainer.json to use published features
   - Update all documentation references
   - Push to main branch

3. **Test both repositories**
   - Create a new project from shared-templates
   - Verify all features install correctly
   - Test template synchronization

4. **Deprecate template-universal**
   - Update README to point to new repositories
   - Consider archiving

### Testing Checklist

See `docs/tasks/milestone-2-testing-checklist.md` for comprehensive testing steps.

Key areas to verify:
- [ ] Claude CLI available
- [ ] Environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Git template remote configured
- [ ] All dev tools installed
- [ ] Works in both local and Codespaces

### Known Issues/Decisions

1. **Same Repository for Template and Features**
   - Decision: Use one repository for both purposes
   - Rationale: Simpler maintenance, features evolve with template
   - Alternative: Could split into separate repos later if needed

2. **Feature Naming**
   - Used descriptive names (e.g., `claude-code-shared-templates-git-remote`)
   - Length isn't a problem, clarity is more important

3. **Telemetry as Separate Feature**
   - Users can opt out by excluding the telemetry feature
   - Provides better privacy control

## Understanding the Architecture

### How Features Work

1. Each feature has:
   - `devcontainer-feature.json` - Metadata and options
   - `install.sh` - Installation script run during container build
   - `test.sh` - Verification script

2. Features are referenced in devcontainer.json and installed in order

3. Once published, features are versioned and cached

### Template Synchronization

The `claude-code-shared-templates-git-remote` feature enables:
```bash
# Pull updates from template
git fetch template
git merge template/main

# Contribute improvements back
git cherry-pick <commit>
git push fork feature-branch
# Create PR to template repo
```

- **Completion Summary**: `docs/tasks/milestone-2-completion-summary.md` - Detailed changes
- **Template Sync Workflow**: `docs/claude/workflows/01-template-sync.md` - How to sync

## Success Criteria

- [x] Features created and structured
- [x] Documentation reorganized
- [x] CI/CD workflows configured
- [ ] Features tested in both environments
- [ ] Features published to registry
- [ ] At least one project successfully uses published features

- Review PRs via `gh pr create`
- Direct communication preferred (Crocker's Rules apply)

## Final Notes

This milestone establishes a sustainable pattern for sharing development environment improvements across projects. The modular feature approach allows teams to pick exactly what they need while maintaining consistency where it matters.

The next developer should focus on:
1. Testing thoroughly
2. Publishing features
3. Documenting any issues discovered
4. Creating the first example of a project using these published features
