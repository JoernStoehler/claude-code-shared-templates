# MCP Server Implementations

This directory is reserved for future Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementations.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol allows Claude to interact with external services and data sources through a standardized interface. MCP servers can provide:

- Access to databases
- Integration with APIs
- File system operations beyond the workspace
- Custom tool implementations
- Real-time data feeds

## Future Plans

As the project evolves, we may add MCP servers for:

- **Database access** - Direct SQL query capabilities
- **External APIs** - Integrated third-party services
- **Monitoring tools** - System metrics and logs
- **Domain-specific tools** - Custom business logic

## Implementation Guidelines

When adding MCP servers:

1. Create a subdirectory for each server
2. Include comprehensive documentation
3. Follow the MCP specification
4. Add appropriate tests
5. Document security considerations

## Status

Currently no MCP servers are implemented. This directory structure is prepared for future additions.
